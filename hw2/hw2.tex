\section{Dynamic Mode Decomposition}

\subsection{Full Clean Data} % a -----------------------------------------------

The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) was performed on the vorticity of flow past a cylinder. A snapshot visualizing the flow field is shown in Figure \ref{fig1a1}. The first 21 eigenvalues of this DMD solution are shown in Figure \ref{fig1a2}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig1a_snapshot.pdf}
    \caption{Snapshot of clean data}
    \label{fig1a1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{fig1a_eigs.pdf}
    \caption{Eigenvalues of clean data}
    \label{fig1a2}
\end{figure}

For a discrete-time system, eigenvalues on the unit circle represent purely oscillatory modes (with no damping/dissipation). This is physically equivalent to energy conservation.

\subsection{Full Noisy Data} % b -----------------------------------------------

Noise of three different magnitudes was added to the vorticity data and the DMD was performed again for each magnitude of noise. Snapshots visualizing the impact of noise are shown in Figures \ref{fig1b1}, \ref{fig1b2}, and \ref{fig1b3}. The first 21 eigenvalues of these DMD solutions are shown in Figures \ref{fig1b4}, \ref{fig1b5}, and \ref{fig1b6}.

The DMD eigenvalues of the noisy data are misleading because they do not lie on the unit circle, but rather inside of it. This implies energy dissipation, which is not actually occurring in the underlying data; this is an artifact of the added noise. The more significant first few modes are less sensitive to noise than the less significant later modes.

    \label{fig1b6}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Subset of Clean Data} % c ------------------------------------------

The vorticity data was truncated so that its length was 75\% of the vortex shedding period and DMD was performed on this truncated data.

The DMD eigenvalues of the truncated data also lie within the unit circle, falsely implying dissipation. Unlike for the noisy data, the sensitivity of the various modes to this source of error is more evenly distributed across the modes (but the higher modes are still more sensitive).

\subsection*{Physics-Informed Dynamic Mode Decomposition}

In this flow field, physics that would be useful to include would be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item periodicity (energy conservation)
    \item shift-invariance
    \item mass continuity
\end{itemize}

\section{Physics-Informed Neural Networks}

\subsection{Loss Function} % a -------------------------------------------------

The physics-informed loss function $L$ is defined as:
\begin{align*}
    L(\theta) &=
    \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{u}, u\right)
    + \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{v}, v\right)
    + \operatorname{MSE}\left(\ppf{\hat{u}}{x} + \ppf{\hat{v}}{y}, 0\right)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\operatorname{MSE}(a, b) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (b-a)^2$
    \item $\lambda$ is the weight of the physics loss term
    \item $n$ is the number of training data points
    \item $m$ is the number of virtual points (for computing physics error)
    \item $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the true velocity vector
    \item $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}$ is the estimated velocity vector computed by the model $f_\theta(\boldsymbol{x})$
\end{itemize}
The first two terms of $L$ are the mean-squared error (MSE) of the model $f_\theta$ across all $n$ training data points. The third term of $L$ is the mean-squared \textit{physics} error (flow divergence) of $f_\theta$ across all $m$ virtual points.

\subsection{Full Data} % b -------------------------------------------------

Interpolation outperforms my PINN with the full data.

    \centering
    \caption{Full data model performance}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        flow & method & data loss \\
        \hline
        \hline
        linear potential vortex & neural network & 6.478e-05 \\
        linear potential vortex & linear interpolation & 4.545e-33 \\
        Taylor-Green potential vortex & neural network & 1.164e+00 \\
        Taylor-Green potential vortex & linear interpolation & 1.123e+00 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab1b}
\end{table}

\subsection{Half Data} % c -------------------------------------------------

My PINN should outperform linear interpolation when trained on half of the data and tested on the other half. I think there's an issue with my linear potential vortex interpolation implementation.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Half data model extrapolation performance}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        flow & method & data loss \\
        \hline
        \hline
        linear potential vortex & PINN & 1.760e-01 \\
        linear potential vortex & linear interpolation & 1.573e-31 \\
        Taylor-Green potential vortex & PINN & 1.101e+00 \\
        Taylor-Green potential vortex & linear interpolation & 2.180e+00 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab1c}
\end{table}

\subsection{Symmetry} % d ------------------------------------------------------

The symmetry can be enforced in the linear potential vortex with the following loss term:
\begin{align*}
    \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{u}, -\hat{u}_r\right) + \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{v}, -\hat{v}_r\right)
\end{align*}
and in the Taylor-Green potential vortex with the following loss term:
\begin{align*}
    \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{u}, 1-\hat{u}_m\right) + \operatorname{MSE}\left(\hat{v}, \hat{v}_m\right)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\left(\hat{u}, \hat{v}\right) = f_\theta(x, y)$
    \item $\left(\hat{u}_r, \hat{v}_r\right) = f_\theta(-x, -y)$
    \item $\left(\hat{u}_m, \hat{v}_m\right) = f_\theta(-x, y)$
\end{itemize}

My PINN with symmetry loss should outperform linear interpolation when trained on half of the data and tested on the other half. I think there's an issue with my linear potential vortex interpolation implementation.

Enforcing symmtetry leads to improvement over the PINN without symmetry for the linear potential vortex.

        Taylor-Green potential vortex & linear interpolation & 2.180e+00 \\
        \hline

\section*{Code Appendix}

Note that code for Section 2.a was modified and re-run for Section 2.b and similarly for Section 2.c, so only code for Section 2.c is shown.
